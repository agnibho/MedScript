    <p>MedScript is a medical prescription writing software. It is primarily for medical practitioners for writing prescriptions.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the program is to enable medical practitioners to prepare computerized prescriptions. The program has been designed after the commonly used prescription format among the medical practitioners in India. Inclusion of prescription style of other regions will hopefully be implemented in future updates.</p>

    <h2>File</h2>

    <p>The program uses a custom file format .mpaz (Medical Prescription Archive - Zipped). It is a zip file in a specific format. The file can be shared, however, no mechanism of ensuring authenticity of a shared file is currently in place.</p>

    <h2>Install</h2>

    <p>MedScript can be used by simply downloading it from the repository and running it with the Python interpreter. The necessary python libraries need to be installed. Alternatively the release versions can be downloaded and used directly.</p>

    <h2>Usage</h2>

    <p>The common functionalities of the program can be used within the graphical interface. Editing of some configuration files are needed only for the advanced features such as custom presets.</p>
    <p>When starting the program, the main window of is shown.The menu bar at the top can be used to access most of the functions. The toolbar below it contains the most commonly used functions for quick access.</p>

    <h3>Creating a prescription</h3>

    <p>A new prescription can be created right from the starting window.  Alternatively the "New" menu option can be used to create a new prescription.</p>
    <p>There are eight tabs in the tab bar containing important parts of a prescription.</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Patient tab:</strong> It contains the demographical data of the patient, diagnosis and a few extra parameters of the prescription.</li>
      <li><strong>Clinical tab:</strong> It contains the clinical note regarding the patient. The presets can be selected from the preset box at the top and inserted into the note by clicking the insert button.</li>
      <li><strong>Report tab:</strong> It contains the reports shown by the patient. It also has the preset option.</li>

      <li><strong>Attachment tab:</strong> Files e.g. PDF, images may be attached to the prescription file from the attachment tab. These attachments can be viewed later when opening the prescription file with the program. However, this attachments are not printed with the prescription.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Saving a prescription</h3>

    <p>The "Save" or the "Save As" option from the "File" menu can be used to save a file created or edited in the program.</p>

    <h3>Opening a prescription</h3>

    <p>The prescriptions are saved in .mpaz files and can be shared easily. To open a prescription file, the "Open" option from the file menu can be used.  Alternatively the file name can be supplied to the program as command line argument when starting from the command line.</p>

    <h3>Rendering a prescription</h3>

    <p>The prescriptions can be rendered and subsequently printed from the "Prepare" menu by selecting the "Render" option. Note that the files must be saved before rendering. The rendered prescription is opened in a separate window. It can be saved as PDF or it can be opened in the system browser and printed from there.</p>

    <h3>Template</h3>

    <p>The program uses jinja2 template for rendering the prescription. A default template is provided with the program. However, other templates (see default template for reference) can be created and placed in the template folder to be used for rendering the prescriptions. The drop down option in the toolbar can be used to switch between available templates.</p>
    <p>Note that the templates are packaged with the .mpaz file which can be used for rendering. However, modifying/saving the file overwrites it.</p>

    <h3>Prescriber</h3>

    <p>The program is primarily targeted towards individual practitioners. However, it can be easily adapted for multiple practitioners.</p>
    <p>The data of the practitioner is stored in json files in the prescriber directory. The default file to be loaded is configured in the config file. A command line option can be used to specify which alternative prescriber file to load in the program, e.g. <em>&lt;program&gt; --prescriber &lt;prescriber file&gt;</em>.</p>
    <p>The data of the currently selected prescriber can be edited using the "Prescriber" option under the "Prepare" menu.</p>

    <h2>Preset</h2>

    <p>The program uses a preset system to insert repeatedly used text without the need to type them. To use this feature the text must be entered beforehand to the respective files. These files are in the .csv format and can be edited with any spreadsheet editing software.</p>
    <p>The preset files are kept in the preset directory. The files associated with clinical note, report, advice, investigation, medication and additional are note.csv, report.csv, advice.csv, investigation.csv, medication.csv and additional.csv. Each file contains a top row indicating the variables in the columns. The data is entered in two columns with each row containing a KEY and a TEXT. The TEXT can be entered in to the edit area by selecting the KEY from the preset input.</p>

    <h2>Configuration</h2>

    <p>The default configuration file contains sane defaults and the program can be used without editing it. However, the json formatted configuration file can be edited to further tune the program to the users preference.</p>
    <p>The default configuration is the config.json located in the config directory.  However, a different config file may be provided by using the <em>&lt;program&gt; --config &lt;config file&gt;</em> command line argument.</p>
    <p>It is recommended to use the default config file as base while creating another customized config file.</p>
